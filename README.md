# MNIST Playground

This repository started as a minimal MNIST-from-scratch implementation (a simple classifier and UI built without frameworks).
It has since evolved into a place to experiment with different MNIST-related models and ideas.

## Contents

`from_scratch/` — original handwritten implementation from first principles

`conv/` — convolutional neural network (PyTorch) implementation

## Purpose

A playground for exploring and learning concepts in machine learning and deep learning, using MNIST as the testing ground.
